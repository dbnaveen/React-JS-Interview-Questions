#### useMemo()


- It returns a memoized value.
- It caches the value so that it doesn't have to be recalculated.
- It runs only when one of its dependencies get updated.
- The useMemo and useCallback Hooks are similar. The main difference is that useMemo returns a memoized value and useCallback returns a memoized function.
